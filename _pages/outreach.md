# Outreach and Social Involvements

My professional growth has greatly benefited from interacting with people from diverse cultures. From organizing community outreaches and working with stakeholders at REA to working with a global team at INTEGRATION Consulting.

      <p class="toggle-paragraph"> My participation in the <a href="https://yaliwestafrica.net/rlc/">YALI </a> (12-week leadership training) not only prepared me for life after school but also equipped me with the necessary knowledge to successfully co-convene <a href="https.//facebook.com/tag.com.ng">The Advantage Group </a>, an organization formed with the vision of giving students and graduates a competitive edge that distinguishes them globally. Each year, we organize inspiring outreaches, conferences and workshops designed to equip students and graduates with essential knowledge and skills in various areas, including academics, entrepreneurship, renewable energy, the environment, leadership, and career development. The first edition, TAGâ€™17, was organized by a team of ten under my direction and attracted approximately 500 participants. To date, we have built a network of over 3,000 Nigerian students. <br />

      <p class="toggle-paragraph">Building on the success of TAG over the year, my team took on the responsibility of organizing the World Environment Day celebration. During the event, we led several community service initiatives, including tree-planting exercise within the FUTO environment, clean-up campaign in parks, drainages, and the Otamiri River within the school environment. We also arranged panel discussions with experts on relevant topics on climate change and environmental conservation. <br />

      <p class="toggle-paragraph">This study examines the impact of land use and land cover (LULC) changes on soil erosion rates within the Otamiri watershed spanning across Owerri to Rivers States, Southern, Nigeria. Using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) integrated with remote sensing and GIS technologies, the research tracks LULC changes between 1996 and 2016. The findings indicate significant deforestation and land conversion, leading to increased soil erosion. This necessitates the implementation of sustainable land management practices to mitigate further degradation. <br />
