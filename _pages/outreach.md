      <p class="toggle-paragraph"> My participation in the <a href="https://yaliwestafrica.net/rlc/">YALI </a> (12-week leadership training) not only prepared me for life after school but also equipped me with the necessary knowledge to successfully co-convene <a href="https.//facebook.com/tag.com.ng">The Advantage Group </a>, an organization formed with the vision of giving students and graduates a competitive edge that distinguishes them globally. Each year, we organize inspiring outreaches, conferences and workshops designed to equip students and graduates with essential knowledge and skills in various areas, including academics, entrepreneurship, renewable energy, the environment, leadership, and career development. The first edition, TAG’17, was organized by a team of ten under my direction and attracted approximately 500 participants. To date, we have built a network of over 3,000 Nigerian students. <br />
