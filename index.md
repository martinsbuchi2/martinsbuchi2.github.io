I’m experienced Remote Sensing and GIS expert, with a proven track record of leveraging Integrated Programming, Earth Observation and GIS services to support informed decision-making. I am intellectually curious, a fast learner, result-oriented, intuitively data-driven, and fully prepared for the rigors of a graduate program abroad to deepen my expertise and make an even more profound impact in society.
